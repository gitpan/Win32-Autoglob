NAME
    Win32::Autoglob -- expand globs in @ARGV when the shell doesn't

SYNOPSIS
    In a Perl program:

      use Win32::Autoglob;
      foreach my $thing (@ARGV) {
        print "And also $thing\n";
      }

    Or from the command line:

      perl -MWin32::Autoglob

DESCRIPTION
    Normal MSWindows shells are exceptional in that they don't do globbing for you -- i.e., if
    you enter:

      C:\stuff> perl thing.pl whatever.bin *.txt thing.dat

    then thing.pl's @ARGV will consist of just `('whatever.bin', '*.txt', 'thing.dat')'.

    If you just add `use Win32::Autoglob;' in your program, this module will alter @ARGV by
    performing globbing. I.e., `'*.txt'' will be expanded to whatever *.txt matches, like
    `('whatever.bin', 'junk.txt', 'stuff.txt', 'thing.dat')' -- or if there are no *.txt
    files, you'll just get an @ARGV of `('whatever.bin', 'thing.dat')'.

    Under Cygwin or under anything but MSWin, this module has no effect, so you can use `use
    Win32::Autoglob;' in any program, and the globbing will happen only when it's running
    under MSWin (and not Cygwin, because Cygwin *does* do globbing).

FUNCTIONS
    None.

VARIABLES
    None. (But it can affect @ARGV.)

THANKS
    Thanks to Citizen X and Dave Adler for help.

HINT
    If you have a program called funkify.pl written for under Unix, consider putting it in a
    directory in your path, and just creating a funkify.bat along with it, consisting of just
    this:

      @echo off
      perl -MWin32::Autoglob -S funkify.pl %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
